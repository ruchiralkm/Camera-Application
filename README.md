- **Filters**: Apply different visual effects like Sepia, Vivid Colors and more.
- **Countdown Timer**: Take pictures after a 5-second countdown.
- **Switch Camera**: Toggle between the front and rear cameras (on supported devices).
- **Capture and Save**: Take snapshots and download the image as a PNG file.

## Technologies Used
